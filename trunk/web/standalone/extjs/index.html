        <pre>Hello! My name is Bohdan. This is my personal website, this implies I'm the author of it.
So, wellcome to my site. You probably wonder why did I choose default wallpaper with Eliza Dushku.
 Well, I just like this actress and I had for a long time wallpaper with her on my real desktop.
About this site. It is nothing special, just a slightly modified example of Web Desktop Sample by Sencha.
About myself. I live in Lviv, Ukraine, but I don't mind moving to USA.
I am mathematician and programmer, developer. Also I am Ph.D. student.
Currently I'm finishing my Ph.D. studies and would like to defend my Ph.D. thesis as soon as possible
to dedicate myself completely to programming and developing applications.
I have been writing programs from my childhood. My first programs were quite simple, written on Pascal for DOS.
Later on I started writing programs on Delphi for Windows operating system 
and I wrote many non-profitable and non-commercial applications.
During my study at the university I was helping to write applications and explaining how to write programs 
to every student, both older and younger than me.
Then I was employed at my first IT company where I was taught to copypaste code and not to invent a bicycle.
This was my first commercial experience. I used there Delphi as programming language, 
MS SQL Server as  relational database management system and SVN as Subversion client System.
Later on I moved to another company  where we were developing a lot of optimization algorythms for Ukrainian Railway
and for Ukrainian Gas and Oil System.
After that  I entered postgraduate studies.
Recently I was employed at another IT company, where I received commercial experience of developing web applications
on Java as server language of IBM WebSphere server, JavaScript as client language using jQuery and Ext JS frameworks.
Also I developed numerous non-profitable and non-commercial sites using simple primitive HTML, CSS, somewhere I used PHP
as server language and MySQL as relational database management system.
I have a dream to adapt all my old Delphi applications to both mobile and web platforms. 
By mobile platforms I mean Android, Windows Phone 7, maybe iPhone.
And by web platforms I mean client JS frameworks like jQuery and Ext JS.
By the way, if you noticed, this site has actually one of my old Delphi applications adapted for a web called Matches.
Also I supervise work of two my friends, I teach one of them to develop applications on Java and  Android SDK Tools,
and I teach another one how to write applications on C++, C# and Windows Phone 7 SDK.
Also I won a lot of competitions and olympiads, for example I received this gold medal from Ariel University of Samaria.
Have you seen it? I won it in Fifth Internet Olympiad. Full list of my achievements is provided in my CV.
Ok, I think that's enough. Thank you for your time and your attention. Best regards. Bye.</pre>
